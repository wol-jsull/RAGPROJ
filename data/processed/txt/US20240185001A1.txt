For example, at least one embodiment pertains to efficient generation of datasets used to train conversational machinelearning models. BACKGROUND [0002] Artificial intelligence is consistently being used to automate new and more complex tasks that were previously performed by humans. In addition to designing efficient and effective machine-learning model (MLM) architectures, the successful deployment or application of the MLMs also depends heavily on the training techniques employed. For example, training an MLM to perform a specific task often requires large amounts of training data, and the data needs to be relevant or tuned to the specific task of the MLM. For example, training a natural language processing MLM specialized in a particular conversational domain (e.g., retail sales dialogues) typically involves many examples of relevant conversations in the retail sales spаce. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS [0003] system that uses task-specific data, template queries, and a trained large language model for generating training data, according to at least one embodiment; [0004] which may generate training data and train a conversational machine-learning model, according to at least one embodiment: [0005] generation of training data and training of a conversational machine-learning model, according to at least one embodiment: [0006] according to at least one embodiment; [0007] which is used by a trained large language model to generate a natural-language query, according to at least one embodiment: [0008] using task-specific data, template queries, and a trained large language model for generating training data, according to at least one embodiment; [0009] generating a template query using a machine-learning model with learned virtual tokens, according to at least one embodiment; [0010] according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure: [0011] according to at least one embodiment; [0012] neural network, according to at least one embodiment; [0013] advanced computing pipeline, according to at least one embodiment; and [0014] for training, adapting, instantiating and deploying machine learning models in an advanced computing pipeline, according to at least one embodiment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0015] Obtaining a sufficient amount of data to adequately train machine-learning models (MLMs) may be accomplished through crowdsourcing efforts, purchasing data from a vendor, collecting data through preexisting infrastructure, and/or generating synthetic data, all of which can be expensive and/or time consuming. Sometimes the task to be performed requires access to private or sensitive data, which makes obtaining and/or using such data more difficult e.g., the data may need to be reviewed and edited to remove private or sensitive information. In addition, some existing methods of data collection or generation result in a limited variety of data such that, even if a developer has acquired a large amount of data, the data may not have much variety. When using data of limited variety, the MLMs trained on this data may not be very robust or versatile. Such difficulties related to collecting or generating large quantities of varied data can make training and deploying MLMs infeasible for development teams with limited budgets or short timelines. [0016] As a non-limiting example, trained MLMs can be used for task-oriented dialogue systems (e.g., chatbots, digital avatars, etc.). These models, once trained, may respond to user prompts that are similar to the prompts that were seen by the model during training. As a result, to create a robust MLM that responds well to a variety of user interactions, it is important to train the MLM using data that realistically approximates the variety of interactions that are to be supported by the MLM. Thus, the training data should be sufficiently varied to train the MLM to respond to a variety of prompts, and should also be tailored specifically to the domain(s) in which the MLM will be used (e.g., restaurant ordering, hotel reservations, financial transactions, and/or the like). Sometimes, when such data is not readily available and cannot feasibly be collected through other means, generative grammars or template forms are used to create synthetic training data. However, this often leads to a lack of linguistic diversity due to the restrictive nature of templates and to accidental inclusion of ungrammatical or implausible examples e.g., by forcing information into template slot locations that result in unnatural or improper language. [0017] Aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure address these and other technological challenges by using a combination of structured data, domain-specific prompts, and large language models (LLMs) (e.g., large generative language models) to generate robust and varied datasets that can be used to effectively train MLMs for, without limitation, task-oriented dialogue systems. By using specifically engineered prompts and structured data that corresponds to the task that the MLM is being trained to perform, the disclosed embodiments can create synthetic datasets that simulate the varied interactions that the trained MLM is likely to encounter in deployment. [0018] In some embodiments, the disclosed techniques may include obtaining a set of structured data which may refer to data organized according to a particular format or data model, and may include task-specific terms. For example, if the synthetic dataset to be generated is for an MLM that will be used to facilitate restaurant ordering US 2024/0185001 A1 Jun. 6, 2024 interactions, the structured data may include menu items available at the restaurant (e.g., hot dog, hamburger, fries, soda, etc.). The disclosed techniques may then combine a template query with a sampling of the structured data, where the template query may include one or more examples of input/output pairings that a LLM may be trained to replicate. For example, the template query may include a domainspecific example query and a natural language (NL) response to the example query. The template query may also include placeholders that may be replaced by the sampled structured data. By using the same template query with different samplings of the structured data, many different query prompts can be created. [0019] The prompt may then be passed to a LLM, and the LLM may then generate a conversational (e.g., natural language) query in response to the prompt that can be included in the generated dataset. In some embodiments, the template query may include a condition or a condition template that targets the output of the LLM to a sub-task of the overall task to be performed. The condition may include a placeholder for a single task-specific datum from the sampled structured data. The single task-specific datum may be stored with the output generated by the LLM in the generated dataset and may be used as a target result for the generated output. The target result may represent the desired output or action of the dialogue system, which may include a target output of a natural language understanding (NLU) system (e.g., intents, slots, or another semantic representation), the desired action of the dialogue system (e.g., whether to call a backend system application programmer interface (API)), and/or the desired natural language response to the user. [0020] In some embodiments, the template query may be selected randomly from a collection of template queries. In embodiments, the template query may be selected from collection of template queries using weighted sampling. To increase the diversity of the generated outputs, the template queries may include examples of outputs that use colloquial phrasing or descriptions of task-specific items instead of naming the task-specific item directly. Some template queries may include outputs that do not correspond to any task-specific item, and/or some template queries may include examples of long or complex outputs or outputs that include terms modifying task-specific items. Because the LLM has been trained on such a large amount of data, the LLM may be able to appropriately respond to the varied template queries and generate a more varied set of conversational query outputs. As a result, the dialogue system trained using the conversational query outputs will be able to appropriately respond to a large variety of user interactions. [0021] In one or more embodiments, the outputs generated using the LLM may be classified and labelled as realistic outputs or unrealistic outputs. Using these labelled outputs, the template queries may be tuned so that more realistic outputs than unrealistic outputs are generated by the LLM. For example, virtual tokens may be included in the template queries before being passed to a token-learning machinelearning model, and the model may then learn a set of tokens that result in the best outputs. These tokens may then be included in the template queries that are combined with the structured task-specific data to create prompts for the LLM. [0022] The advantages of the disclosed techniques include but are not limited to systems and methods that are capable of generating a large amount of task-specific training data without the time and expense required by traditional data collection methods. By using specially curated template queries and task-specific structured data, the disclosed techniques can also create training data that includes more linguistic diversity and less ungrammatical or implausible examples than other dataset generation methods.

As depicted in repository 110, a query generator system 120, a training data repository 170, and a task-oriented dialogue system 180 connected to a network(s) 160. Network(s) 160 may be a public network (e.g., the Internet), a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN), or wide area network (WAN)), a wireless network, a personal area network (PAN), another network type, and/or a combination thereof. [0024] Query generator system 120 include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a server, a wearable device, a virtual reality (VR)/ augmented reality (AR)/mixed reality (MR) headset or heads up display, a digital avatar or chat bot kiosk, an in-vehicle infotainment computing device, and/or any suitable computing device capable of performing the techniques described herein. Query generator system 120 may be configured to receive task data 112 and template query 114. Task data 112 and template query 114 may be related to the task(s) to be performed using the task-oriented dialogue system. For example, if the task-oriented dialogue system is to be used to facilitate ordering items from a restaurant, task data 112 may include one or more menu items available to order at the restaurant. Similarly, template query 114 may include examples of a menu with items and a natural language (NL) query requesting one or more items from the menu. Task data 112 and template query 114 may be retrieved from task data repository 110 connected to query generator system 120, retrieved from memory 130 of query generator system 120, and/or received over any local or network connection (e.g., via network 160) from an external computing device. Task data 112 and template query 114 may be in any suitable format, e.g., plain text, XML, CSV, JSON, YAML, or any other compressed or uncompressed format. In some embodiments, task data 112 and/or template query 114 may be stored in a data store (e.g., a relational database, an objectoriented database, a key-value store, etc.). [0025] Task data repository 110 may include a persistent storage capable of storing task-specific data, templates, and/or metadata corresponding to the stored data and templates. Task data repository 110 may be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage disks, tapes, or hard drives, network-attached storage (NAS), storage area network (SAN), and so forth. Although depicted as separate from query generator system 120, in at least some embodiments, task data repository 110 may be a part of query generator system 120. In at least some embodiments, task data repository 110 may be a networkattached file server, while in other embodiments task data repository 110 may be some other type of persistent storage such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, US 2024/0185001 A1 Jun. 6, 2024 and so forth, that may be hosted by a server machine or one or more different machines coupled to the query generator system 120 via network 160. [0026] Query generator system 120 may include a memory 130 (e.g., one or more memory devices or units) communicatively coupled with one or more processing devices, such as one or more graphics processing units (GPU) 150 and/or one or more central processing units (CPU) 140. Memory 130 may store one or more codes, such as a query prompt generator 132 and a trained large language model 134. Any or all of query prompt generator 132 and/or trained large language model 134 may be executed using GPU 150 and/or CPU 140. In some embodiments, query prompt generator 132 may use task data 112 and template query 114 as an input. Task data 112 and template query 114 may be combined using query prompt generator 132 to generate a query prompt. Trained large language model 134 may process the generated query prompt to create a generated NL query 172. Trained large language model 134 may be any trained machine-learning model capable of performing text completion based on a provided example (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, ROBERTa, Megatron). In some embodiments, query prompt generator 132 may also generate a target result 174. Generated NL query 172 and/or target result 174 may be stored in training data repository 170, stored in memory 130 of query generator system 120, and/or transmitted over any local or network connection (e.g., via network 160) for storage in an external computing device. In some embodiments, training data repository 170 may be connected directly to query generator system 120. In other embodiments, training data repository 170 may be connected to query generator system 120 over a network connection (e.g., via network(s) 160) as shown in Generated NL query 172 and target result 174 may be stored in any suitable format, e.g., plain text, XML, CSV, JSON, YAML, or any other compressed or uncompressed format. In some embodiments, generated NL query 172 and target result 174 may be stored in a data store (e.g., a relational database, an object-oriented database, a key value store, etc.). Further details about generating NL query 172 and/or target result 174 from task data 112 and template query 114 are disclosed herein at least with respect to FIGS. 3-4. [0027] Training data repository 170 may include a persistent storage capable of storing generated NL queries and target results as well as metadata for the stored queries and target results. Training data repository 170 may be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage disks, tapes, or hard drives, networkattached storage (NAS), storage area network (SAN), and so forth. Although depicted as separate from query generator system 120, in at least some embodiments, training data repository 170 may be a part of query generator system 120. In at least some embodiments, training data repository 170 may be a network-attached file server, while in other embodiments training data repository 170 may be some other type of persistent storage such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, and so forth, that may be hosted by a server machine or one or more different machines coupled to the query generator system 120 via network 160. [0028] Task-oriented dialogue system 180 may include a memory 190 communicatively coupled with one or more processing devices, such as one or more GPUs 150 and one or more CPUs 140. Memory 190 may store one or more codes, such as conversational machine-learning model (MLM) 192 and/or training engine 194. Any or all of conversational MLM 192 and/or training engine 194 may be executed using GPU(s) 150, CPU(s) 140, and/or another processing unit type (e.g., an accelerator, such as a deep learning accelerator (DLA)). In some embodiments, training engine 194 may use generated NL query 172 to train conversational MLM 192. In other embodiments, training engine 194 may use generated NL query 172 and target result 174 to train conversational MLM 192. Task-oriented dialogue system 180 may retrieve generated NL query 172 and/or target result 174 from training data repository 170, which may be directly connected to task-oriented dialogue system 180 or may be connected to task-oriented dialogue system 180 over a network connection (e.g., via network(s) 160), as shown in [0029] In at least one embodiment, trained large language model 134 and/or conversational MLM 192 may be implemented as deep learning neural networks having multiple levels of linear or non-linear operations. For example, trained large language model 134 and/or conversational MLM 192 may include convolutional neural layers, recurrent neural layers, fully connected neural networks, neural networks with memory layers/subnetworks, and/or so on. In at least one embodiment, trained large language model 134 and/or conversational MLM 192 may include multiple neurons, where one or more individual neurons may receive its input from one or more other neurons and/or from an external source, and may produce an output by applying an activation function to the sum of weighted inputs and a bias value. In at least one embodiment, trained large language model 134 and/or conversational MLM 192 may include multiple neurons arranged in layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and/or an output layer. In embodiments, neurons from adjacent layers may be connected by weighted edges. [0030] Generated NL query 172 may be used by training engine 194 to identify parameters (e.g., neural weights, biases, parameters of activation functions, etc.) of conversational MLM 192 that maximize success of task-oriented dialogue system 180. In some embodiments, training of conversational MLM 192 may be supervised, e.g., using human-annotations of generated NL query 172 as ground truth or using target result 174 as ground truth. In other embodiments, training of conversational MLM 192 may be unsupervised. In at least one embodiment, query generator system 120 and task-oriented dialogue system 180 may be implemented on a single computing device. Query generator system 120 and/or task-oriented dialogue system 180 may be (and/or include) a rackmount server, a router computer, a personal computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, a media center, another device type, or any combination thereof. [0031] Initially, parameters (e.g., edge weights and biases) of conversational MLM 192 may be assigned some starting (e.g., random) values. For every training input (e.g., generated NL query 172), training engine 194 may cause conversational MLM 192 to generate training output(s). Training engine 194 may then compare observed output(s) with the desired target output(s). The desired target output(s) may include target result 174 and/or human-annotated ground truths corresponding to the input (e.g., generated NL query 172). The resulting error or mismatch, e.g., the difference between the desired target output(s) and the actual output(s) US 2024/0185001 A1 Jun. 6, 2024 of conversational MLM 192, may be back-propagated through conversational MLM 192, and the weights and biases in the conversational MLM 192 may be adjusted to make the actual or predicted output(s) closer to the target (ground truth) output(s). This adjustment may be repeated until the output error for a given training input satisfies a predetermined condition (e.g., falls below a predetermined value). Subsequently, a different training input may be selected, a new output generated, and a new series of adjustments implemented, until conversational MLM 192 is trained to (e.g., converges to) a target degree of accuracy. Although training of conversational MLM 192 is described in the aforementioned example, similar operations may be performed in training of other MLMs (e.g., large language model 134).

In at least one embodiment, computing device may be a part of query generator system 120. In at least one embodiment, computing device 200 may be a part of task-oriented dialogue system 180. In at least one embodiment, query prompt generator 132, trained large language model 134, conversational MLM 192, and/or training engine may be executed using one or more GPUs 150 (and/or other parallel processing units (PPUs) or accelerators, such as a deep learning accelerator, a data processing unit (DPU), etc.) and/or one or more CPUs 140. In at least one embodiment, a GPU 150 includes multiple cores 151, each core being capable of executing multiple threads 152. Each core may run multiple threads 152 concurrently (e.g., in parallel). In at least one embodiment, threads 152 may have access to registers 153. Registers 153 may be thread-specific registers with access to a register restricted to a respective thread. Additionally, shared registers 154 may be accessed by one or more (including all) threads of the core 151. In at least one embodiment, individual cores 151 may include a scheduler to distribute computational tasks and processes among different threads 152 of core 151. A dispatch unit 156 may implement scheduled tasks on appropriate threads using correct private registers 153 and shared registers 154. Computing device 200 may include input/output component(s) to facilitate exchange of information with one or more users or developers. [0033] In at least one embodiment, GPU 150 may have a (high-speed) cache 158, access to which may be shared by multiple cores 151. Furthermore, computing device 200 may include a GPU memory 220 where GPU 150 may store intermediate and/or final results (outputs) of various computations performed using GPU 150. After completion of a particular task, GPU 150 (or CPU 140) may move the output to (main) memory 210. In at least one embodiment, CPU may execute processes that involve serial computational tasks whereas GPU 150 may execute tasks (such as multiplication of inputs of a neural node by weights and adding biases) that are amenable to parallel processing. In at least one embodiment, specific codes (e.g., query prompt generator 132, trained large language model 134, conversational MLM 192, training engine 194) may determine which processes are to be executed on GPU 150 and which processes are to be executed on CPU 140. In other embodiments, CPU 140 may determine which processes are to be executed on GPU 150 and which processes are to be executed on CPU 140.

In at least one embodiment, the dataset generation system of system 120 and/or task-oriented dialogue system 180, which may be located on a single computing device or on different computing devices. Various blocks in the same numerals as the respective blocks of [0035] As illustrated in may receive task data 112 and template query 114 as input into query generator system 120. Query prompt generator 132 may combine task data 112 and template query to create prompt 310. Prompt 310 may then be provided to trained large language model 134 to generate an output value (e.g., NL query 320). In some embodiments, query prompt generator 132 may also generate target 330. NL query 320 and/or target 330 may then be stored in training data repository 170. Training engine 194 may then use generated NL query 172 (e.g., NL query 320) and target result 174 (e.g., target 330) to train parameters of conversational MLM 192 as described herein. Output generated using conversational MLM 192 (e.g., one or more questionanswer pairs) may be stored in a dialogue data store 340. [0036] Task data 112 may include one or more taskspecific or domain-specific tokens. Tokens may be any words, phrases, abbreviations, sentences, exclamations, and/ or the like, that are encountered in conversations, advertisements, and/or printing materials pertaining to relevant tasks/ domains. For example, if training data is being generated to train a task-oriented dialogue system that may be used in a restaurant environment, task data 112 may include menu items that are available for purchase. If the task-oriented dialogue system may be used in a hotel environment, task data 112 may include room configuration options (e.g., number of beds, bed sizes, smoking/non-smoking room, and/or so on). In a theater environment, task data 112 may include various ticket, location, theater, seating, and/or food options. In some embodiments, task data 112 may include frequently asked questions (FAQs) or may include data from an existing knowledge base (e.g., a company's internal resource center). In other embodiments, task data 112 may include data from more than one domain. [0037] according to at least one embodiment. Template query 114 may include a static portion 410 and a dynamic portion 420. Static portion 410 of template query 114 may include example input/output pairings that trained large language model 134 is to simulate (e.g., using few-shot learning). Individual inputs and outputs of a pair may include a label (e.g., input label, output label) and a value (e.g., input value, output value). In some embodiments, some input/output labels may be the same for multiple example input/output pairings, while the input/output values for those pairings may be different. For example, template query 114 for training a conversational navigation model may include multiple input/output labels that are the same, e.g., "Input label: Destinations" and "Output label: Directions requests," while the input/output values are different. For example, input values may include different lists of prominent city landmarks, e.g., US 2024/0185001 A1 Jun. 6, 2024 [0038] Input value: Convention Center, City Hall, Baseball Stadium. [0039] Output value: How do I get to the Convention Center? [0040] Input value: University, Concert Hall, Fine Arts Museum. [0041] Output value: Where is the Concert Hall? In some embodiments, the input/output labels and the input value for multiple example input/output pairings may be the same while the output values for these input/output pairings may be different. For example, [0042] Input value: Convention Center, City Hall, Baseball Stadium. [0043] Output value: How far is the City Hall? [0044] Input value: Convention Center, City Hall, Baseball Stadium. [0045] Output value: What is the fastest way to the Baseball Stadium? [0046] Dynamic portion 420 of template query 114 may include a dynamic input/output pairing, with each input and output including a label and a value. In some embodiments, dynamic portion 420 may include a dynamic input/output pairing with the same input label and output label as the example input/output pairings in static portion 410 of template query 114. The input value of the dynamic input/output pairing of dynamic portion 420 of template query 114 may include placeholder tokens. The placeholder tokens may be replaced by one or more task-specific or domain-specific tokens from task data 112. The output value of the dynamic input/output pairing of dynamic portion 420 of template query 114 may be left empty for trained large language model 134 to generate according to the examples provided in static portion 410 of template query 114. By replacing the placeholder tokens in dynamic portion 420 of template query 114 with one or more task-specific or domain-specific tokens from task data 112, query prompt generator may generate prompt 310. from task data 112 to create prompt 310. In some embodiments, the list of menu items in the dynamic input value may be the same as the list of menu item in one or more of the example input values. In other embodiments, the menu items of the dynamic input value are completely distinct from the menu items of the example input values, such that no single menu item appears in both the dynamic input value and in an example input value. [0048] prompt 310 which is used by a trained large language model to generate a natural-language (NL) query 320, according to at least one embodiment. Combining task data 112 and template query 114 to generate prompt 310 may be performed using function 430, which may be implemented using query prompt generator 132. Query prompt generator may replace the placeholder tokens of template query with a sampling (e.g., a subset) of task data 112. In some embodiments, sampling task data 112 may be performed randomly. In some embodiments, task data 112 may be associated with selection weights and the sampling of task data 112 may be performed based on a probability determined by the selection weights. The selection weights may be assigned to different items of task data 112, e.g., according to the statistics of usage of such items in language conversations. In some embodiments, items that have a higher probability of usage may be given larger weights. In some embodiments, at least some items that have a lower probability of usage may still be given large weights, e.g., to generate a sufficient number of training queries for training conversational MLM 192 to appropriately handle requests for such rare items. Query prompt generator 132 may select template query 114 randomly (or with probabilities determined by the selection weights) from task data repository 110. In another embodiment, each template query 114 of task data repository 110 may be associated with a selection weight, and query prompt generator 132 may select template [0047] As another example, illustrated with query generator system 120 may generate training data to be used by task-oriented dialogue system 180 in a restaurant ordering environment. Static portion 410 of template query may contain two example input/output pairings (e.g., example input/output 1 and example input/output 2). In some embodiments, the example pairings may be an example conversation between a customer and a service provider. The example pairing may come from a financial services domain, a food services domain, a health services domain, a retail services domain, and/or the like. Dynamic portion 420 of template query 114 may contain one dynamic input/output pairing (e.g., dynamic input/output 1). Example input 1 and example input 2 may both have "Menu:" as an input label. Example output 1 and example output 2 may both have "Order:" as an output label. Example input 1 and example input 2 may both have an input value that may include a list of menu items. Example output 1 and example output 2 may both have an output value that may include a NL query (e.g., a NL response) ordering one or more ofthe listed menu items from the respective input value. In some embodiments, the input values (e.g., menu items) may be the same in one or more of the example pairings. The dynamic input/output pairing may also have "Menu:" as an input label and "Order:" as the output label. The input value of the dynamic pairing may have placeholder tokens. The placeholder tokens may be replaced by one or more menu items weight. [0049] As further illustrated in restaurant scenario, prompt 310 may include two example input/output pairings of menu items and an NL query with an example order of one or more of the menu items and one dynamic input/output pairing with a list of menu items populated from (a subset of) task data 112 and an empty output value. Prompt 310 may then be provided to trained large language model 134, with the example input/output pairings providing trained large language model 134 with few-shot examples of the kind of output value to be generated. Trained large language model 134 may then complete the dynamic input/output pairing by generating an output value (e.g., NL query 320). As a result of an extensive amount of data that was used to train trained large language model 134, trained large language model 134 may generate an output that more closely simulates a likely human's response to the same prompt 310. For example, trained large language model 134 may generate an output that includes conversational colloquialisms such as asking for "the twelve-piece" instead of "the twelve-piece chicken bucket." Having such outputs in training data repository 170 may allow training engine 194 to train conversational MLM 192 to respond appropriately to similar colloquialisms. The generated output value (e.g., NL query 320) may then be 170. stored in training data repository US 2024/0185001 A1 Jun. 6, 2024 [0050] With a continuing reference to template query 114 from task data repository 110 and may also select the same or a different task data 112 from task data repository 110. Query generator system 120 may replace the placeholder tokens of the selected template query using the selected task data to generate a new prompt 310. The new prompt 310 may then be provided to trained large language model 134 to generate a new output value (e.g., NL query 320), which may subsequently be stored in training data repository 170 (e.g., as generated NL query 172). This process may continue until a target condition is satisfied, e.g., a certain number of NL queries have been generated, a certain number of task data and/or template queries have been selected, a certain amount of time has elapsed since starting the dataset generation process, or the like. [0051] The above examples are used for the sake of illustration and not limitation. The disclosed techniques have a broad applicability and should not be read as being targeted only to a restaurant ordering environment or a navigation domain. In another embodiment, template query 114, with its associated example input/output pairing(s), and task data 112 may relate to a task of a different domain (e.g., a financial services domain, a health services domain, a retail services domain, or the like). In some embodiments, task data repository 110 may have a plurality of template queries 114, each with one or more associated example input/output pairings and one or more dynamic input/output pairings. The output value generated using trained large language model 134 (e.g., NL query 320) may be tuned by changing the few-shot examples (e.g., static portion 410) of template query 114. To ensure a wide variety of generated NL queries 172, task data repository 110 may include a wide variety of template queries 114. In some embodiments, task data repository 110 may include one or more template queries 114 with no static portion 410 (e.g., zero-shot learning template query) or with one example input/output pairing in static portion 410 (e.g., one-shot learning template query). In some embodiments, an example output value of static portion 410 of a template query 114 may include colloquial phrasing, such as (continuing the restaurant example) ordering a menu item by describing it instead of calling it explicitly by name. In another embodiment, an example output value may include ordering a menu item that is not included in the example input value (e.g., an "offmenu" item). In another embodiment, an example output value may include an order requesting multiple menu items (e.g., "... two burgers, a hot dog, and a salad") and/or an order requesting a menu item with modifications (e.g.,".. . a cheeseburger without cheese or ketchup"). [0052] With a continuing reference to embodiments, query prompt generator 132 may generate a target 330 in addition to prompt 310. In some embodiments, each input ofthe input/output pairings of template query 114 may include a condition. The condition may relate to a sub-task of the domain-specific conversational task to be performed by task-oriented dialogue system 180. The condition may be based on one or more tokens of the corresponding input value. The input of the dynamic input/output pairing may also have a condition, with the condition value based on one or more of the selected task data 112. For example, in the above-mentioned restaurant scenario, an example input/output pairing of template query 114 may include a list of menu items, a condition related to one of the menu items, and a NL query ordering the menu item included in the condition. The condition may have a label and a value. For example, a condition in a template query in the restaurant example may have "Directive:" as a label and "How would you order the hamburger?" as a value. By including a condition in the example input/output pairing (s) of template query 114, the variability of generated NL queries 172 may be restricted. In some embodiments, when the input/output pairings of template query 114 contain conditions, the value of task data 112 that is included in the condition may be selected using query prompt generator 132 as target 330. In some embodiments, conditions may be added to input/output pairings of template query 114 or may be added to prompt 310 before prompt 310 is provided to trained large language model 134.

In at least one embodiment, rather than making a copy of data and moving data to different locations in memory (e.g., a read/ write operation), same data in the same location of a memory may be used for any number of processing tasks (e.g., at the same time, at different times, etc.). In at least one embodiment, as data is used to generate new data as a result of processing, this information of a new location of data may be stored and shared between various applications. In at least one embodiment, location of data and a location of updated or modified data may be part of a definition of how a payload is understood within containers.

In at least one embodiment, applications of deployment pipeline (s) 1010 may use one or more of output models 916 from training system 904 and/or other models of applications to perform inference on imaging data (e.g., DICOM data, RIS data, CIS data, REST compliant data, RPC data, raw data, etc.). In at least one embodiment, two or more examples of inferencing using application orchestration system 1028 (e.g., a scheduler) may be available. In at least one embodiment, a first category may include a high priority/low latency path that may achieve higher service level agreements, such as for performing inference on urgent requests during an emergency, or for a radiologist during diagnosis. In at least one embodiment, a second category may include a standard priority path that may be used for requests that may be non-urgent or where analysis may be performed at a later time. In at least one embodiment, application orchestration system 1028 may distribute resources (e.g., services and/or hardware 922) based on priority paths for different inferencing tasks of AI services 1018. US 2024/0185001 A1 Jun. 6, 2024 [0106] In at least one embodiment, shared storage may be mounted to AI services 1018 within system 1000. In at least one embodiment, shared storage may operate as a cache (or other storage device type) and may be used to process inference requests from applications. In at least one embodiment, when an inference request is submitted, a request may be received by a set of API instances of deployment system 906, and one or more instances may be selected (e.g., for best fit, for load balancing, etc.) to process a request. In at least one embodiment, to process a request, a request may be entered into a database, a machine learning model may be located from model registry 924 if not already in a cache, a validation step may ensure an appropriate machine learning model is loaded into a cache (e.g., shared storage), and/or a copy of a model may be saved to a cache. In at least one embodiment, the scheduler (e.g., of pipeline manager 1012) may be used to launch an application that is referenced in a request if an application is not already running or if there are not enough instances of an application. In at least one embodiment, if an inference server is not already launched to execute a model, an inference server may be launched. In at least one embodiment, any number of inference servers may be launched per model. In at least one embodiment, in a pull model, in which inference servers are clustered, models may be cached whenever load balancing is advantageous. In at least one embodiment, inference servers may be statically loaded in corresponding, distributed servers. [0107] In at least one embodiment, inferencing may be performed using an inference server that runs in a container. In at least one embodiment, an instance of an inference server may be associated with a model (and optionally a plurality of versions of a model). In at least one embodiment, if an instance of an inference server does not exist when a request to perform inference on a model is received, a new instance may be loaded. In at least one embodiment, when starting an inference server, a model may be passed to an inference server such that a same container may be used to serve different models so long as the inference server is running as a different instance. [0108] In at least one embodiment, during application execution, an inference request for a given application may be received, and a container (e.g., hosting an instance of an inference server) may be loaded (if not already loaded), and a start procedure may be called. In at least one embodiment, pre-processing logic in a container may load, decode, and/or perform any additional pre-processing on incoming data (e.g., using a CPU(s) and/or GPU(s)). In at least one embodiment, once data is prepared for inference, a container may perform inference as necessary on data. In at least one embodiment, this may include a single inference call on one image (e.g., a hand X-ray), or may require inference on hundreds of images (e.g., a chest CT). In at least one embodiment, an application may summarize results before completing, which may include, without limitation, a single confidence score, pixel-level segmentation, voxel-level segmentation, generating a visualization, or generating text to summarize findings. In at least one embodiment, different models or applications may be assigned different priorities. For example, some models may have a real-time (turnaround time less than one minute) priority while others may have lower priority (e.g., turnaround less than 10 minutes). In at least one embodiment, model execution times may be measured from requesting institution or entity and may include partner network traversal time, as well as execution on an inference service. [0109] In at least one embodiment, transfer of requests between services 920 and inference applications may be hidden behind a software development kit (SDK), and robust transport may be provided through a queue. In at least one embodiment, a request is placed in a queue via an API for an individual application/tenant ID combination and an SDK pulls a request from a queue and gives a request to an application. In at least one embodiment, a name of a queue may be provided in an environment from where an SDK picks up the request. In at least one embodiment, asynchronous communication through a queue may be useful as it may allow any instance of an application to pick up work as it becomes available. In at least one embodiment, results may be transferred back through a queue, to ensure no data is lost. In at least one embodiment, queues may also provide an ability to segment work, as highest priority work may go to a queue with most instances of an application connected to it, while lowest priority work may go to a queue with a single instance connected to it that processes tasks in an order received. In at least one embodiment, an application may run on a GPU-accelerated instance generated in cloud 1026, and an inference service may perform inferencing on a GPU.

"Connected," when unmodified and referring to physical connections, is to be construed as partly or wholly contained within, attached to, or joined together, even if there is something intervening. Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within range, unless otherwise indicated herein and each separate value is incorporated into specification as if it were individually recited herein. In at least one embodiment, use of the term "set" (e.g., "a set of items") or "subset" unless otherwise noted or contradicted by context, is to be construed as a nonempty collection comprising one or more members. Further, unless otherwise noted or contradicted by context, the term "subset" of a corresponding set does not necessarily denote a proper subset of the corresponding set, but subset and corresponding set may be equal. [0117] Conjunctive language, such as phrases of form "at least one of A, B, and C." or "at least one of A, B and С." unless specifically stated otherwise or otherwise clearly contradicted by context, is otherwise understood with context as used in general to present that an item, term, etc., may be either A or B or C, or any nonempty subset of set of A and B and C. For instance, in illustrative example of a set having three members, conjunctive phrases "at least one of A, В, and C" and "at least one of A, B and C" refer to any of following sets: {A}, {B}, {C}, {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {A, B, C}.
