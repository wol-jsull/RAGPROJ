In a first example, the large language model can execute training operations by processing a training dataset to produce a natural language output. The natural language generation system can analyze the training dataset and the natural language output to generate a natural language output mimicking the output of the large language model. The large language model can then evaluate the output of the natural language generation system to iteratively adjust and improve the quality of natural language outputs. In a second example, the large language can augment a small language model in executing natural language tasks. This is accomplished by retrieving external information using the large language model to generate an augmentation input to provide context and a language framework to the small language model to enhance overall outputs.

in the capability and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) software applications. For instance, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their diverse processing capabilities in vision, speech, language, and decision making. Unlike other AI models, such as recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, transformer-based large language models make use of a native self-attention mechanism to identify vague context from limited available data and even synthesize new content from images and music to software. Commensurate with their capabilities, large language models are complex, oftentimes comprising millions if not billions of individual parameters. Accordingly, various organizations deploy large-scale computing infrastructure, such as cloud computing, to offer Al platforms tailored to enabling user access to cutting-edge large language models. [0002] The ability of large language models to identify and work within vague or indefinite contexts allows large language models to achieve high quality natural language outputs (e.g., text). This ability can be leveraged in various scenarios such as text summarization where an understanding of context and fluency in a natural language (e.g., English) is important. Moreover, large language models can ingest large amounts of training data and maintain learnings across diverse application spaces. That is, information, techniques, and other training data can be learned once and applied endlessly when relevant. [0003] However, large language models can also incur technical costs that may be detrimental in various usage scenarios. For instance, a provider may wish to deploy a large language model in a specific natural language domain (e.g., records management). Unfortunately, due to the high complexity of large language models, deploying a large language model in such a specific context can be impractical. For example, training and adapting the large language model to the specific domain can be inordinately time consuming and resource intensive. SUMMARY [0004] The techniques described herein provide systems for enhancing natural language generation (NLG) systems through large language model training and/or augmentation. As mentioned above, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify vague contexts from input data allows large language models to mimic human intuition and specific domain knowledge. However, adapting and deploying a large language model in a specific domain can also be impractical due to the complexity of large language models leading to excessive resource consumption and limited performance. In contrast, small language models (SMLs),while lacking the same contextual intelligence of large language models, can express comparatively lower resource consumption enabling greater agility and adaptability. As such, the disclosed techniques can utilize large language models to train and/or augment small language models to leverage the benefits of both. [0005] In one example, a large language model can be configured for automated training of a natural language generation system through imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The large language model can receive a dataset comprising a large corpus of unlabeled data such as research publications and conference presentations. In addition, the large language model can receive a natural language generation task (e.g., summarization, query and answer, annotation) which can be formatted as a prompt. In response, the large language model can produce a first natural language output which can serve as a pseudo-label for the dataset. Stated another way, the dataset can be configured by the large language model for training the natural language generation system. [0006] In contrast, traditional training methodologies typically rely on manually labeled training data. Consequently, typical systems can experience limitations on available training data and/or increased costs associated with obtaining manually labeled training data. By labeling the dataset using the large language model, the disclosed system can bypass such costs to streamline the training process thereby improving overall efficiency of the system. [0007] The natural language generation system can subsequently process the dataset along with the first natural language output using an imitation learning protocol. In various examples, the imitation learning protocol can cause the natural language generation system to emulate the behaviors of the large language model when presented with various natural language tasks. For instance, the natural language generation system can learn characteristics of the large language model in the context of a text summarization task. Accordingly, the natural language generation system can apply these behaviors upon encountering a text summarization task to produce a natural language output. [0008] The natural language output produced by the natural language generation system can then be provided to the large language model for evaluation. The large language model can utilize various scoring criteria such as an informativeness parameter, a fluency parameter, and/or a coherence parameter to calculate an output score as well as various feedback inputs. The output score can serve to quantify the quality of the natural language output of the natural language generation system. The natural language generation system can accordingly be configured with a reinforcement learning protocol wherein the objective of the reinforcement learning protocol is to increase the output score overtime. Likewise, the feedback inputs can define various modifications to the natural language generation system to improve the quality of the natural language output (e.g., improve fluency). Over the course of many iterations, the natural language generation system can align with the preferences of the large language model to achieve high performance beyond simply imitating large language model outputs. [0009] As mentioned above, the large language model can bypass the drawbacks of utilizing manually labeled training data by producing first natural language outputs for an input dataset. Similarly, by continuing to utilize the large language model to perform reinforcement learning, the present techniques can further streamline the training process. For instance, typical reinforcement learning systems often utilize human feedback to evaluate and modify models under training. At large scales, collecting human feedback can be costly and impractical which may limit the performance of US 2024/0346254 A1 Oct. 17, 2024 such systems. In contrast, by constructing a reward model comprising the feedback inputs and the output score, the disclosed system can bypass the need to collect human feedback thereby further enhancing efficiency. Moreover, by taking on the behavior of the large language model, the natural language generation system can match and even exceed the performance of the large language model itself by retaining the reduced resource consumption and adaptability inherent to the smaller size of the natural language generation system. [0010] In another example, a large language model can be deployed to augment a natural language generation system in a live deployment context such as a query and answer system. In this context, the large language model can cooperate with a small language model of the natural language generation system to leverage the strengths of both approaches to produce high quality natural language outputs. As mentioned above, large language models benefit from strong language understanding and language generation capabilities across diverse tasks. However, fine tuning and adapting large language models with their tens of billions of parameters can be impractical and unduly resource intensive. In contrast, a small language model can be agilely fine-tuned and adapted with domain-specific data while suffering from generally inferior language understanding and generation quality relative to a large language model. [0011] Accordingly, the present system can process an input dataset and natural language generation task using both the large language model and the small language model. In addition, the large language model can retrieve external information (e.g., articles, webpages) that are relevant to the input dataset and/or the natural language generation task. The large language model can subsequently produce an augmentation input containing selected information extracted from the external information, queries and responses regarding the external information, an output template for formatting the natural language output. [0012] In a specific example, the natural language generation task can be a summarization task where the input dataset is a body of text to be summarized. Accordingly, the large language model can produce keywords, extract important facts such as people and places and the like to generate an augmentation input. The augmentation input can be subsequently provided along with the input dataset and natural language generation task to the small language model of the natural language generation system. The small language model can utilize the augmentation input as a framework to execute the natural language generation task and produce a natural language output. Moreover, because of the live deployment context of the present system, the natural language generation system can collect feedback from users to further fine-tune the natural language generation system. [0013] By augmenting a small language model with a large language model, the disclosed system can extract the technical benefits of both while addressing the potential shortcomings of utilizing a large language model or a small language model individually. As such, the overall performance of natural language generation systems can benefit from enhanced language understanding and generation via the large language model while maintaining the adaptability and domain-specific strengths of a small language model. [0014] Features and technical benefits other than those explicitly described above will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0024] The techniques described herein enhance the operation of natural language generation systems by utilizing a large language model for training and/or augmentation. As mentioned above, despite the strength of large language models in language understanding and generation, the high complexity of large language models can make it impractical to adapt and deploy large language models in specific contexts. Conversely, while small language models boast improved adaptability and resource consumption relative to large language models, small language models can also suffer from generally inferior natural language understanding and generation capabilities. US 2024/0346254 A1 Oct. 17, 2024 [0025] As such, by utilizing a large language model to perform imitation learning and reinforcement learning for a natural language generation system, the disclosed techniques can enable a natural language generation system to take on the behaviors of the large language model across various natural language generation tasks to improve the quality of natural language outputs. Similarly, the large language model can continue to augment the natural language generation system in a live deployment context. For instance, the large language model can produce augmentation outputs based on an input dataset and natural language generation task to guide a small language model in execution of the natural language generation task. In this way, the natural language generation system can produce high quality natural language outputs while retaining adaptability and resource efficiency of a small language model. [0026] Various examples, scenarios, and aspects that enable natural language training and/or augmentation with large language models are described below with respect to FIGS. 1-8. [0027] language model 102 can be configured to train a natural language generation system 104. Examples of the large language model 102 include BLOOM by HUGGING FACE, BERT by GOOGLE, ALEXATM by AMAZON, GPT-4 by OPENAI, and DEBERTA by MICROSOFT. As shown, the large language model 102 can receive a training dataset 106 as well as a natural language generation task 108. In various examples, the natural language generation task 108 can include text summarization, conversational dialogue generation, query response, text synthesis, and so forth. Furthermore, the natural language generation task 108 can be formatted as a plain language prompt configuring the large language model 102 to execute various behaviors (e.g., "summarize these articles"). Moreover, the training dataset can be a large (e.g., thousands, millions) unlabeled corpus of data such as articles, images, audio, software, and the like. In the present context, unlabeled data can include any content that has not been manually altered and/or formatted (i.e., labeled) for the purposes of training an artificial intelligence (AI) program. [0028] Accordingly, the large language model 102 execute the natural language generation task 108 on the training data set 106 to generate a first natural language output 110. In a specific example, the training dataset 106 can comprise a collection of research publications relating to a certain topic (e.g., anthropology, medical technology, history). Furthermore, the natural language generation task 108 can be a plain language prompt configuring the large language model to "summarize these research publications for an academic audience." Consequently, the first natural language output 110 can be a body of text summarizing important aspects of each of the research publications within the training dataset 106 such as important researchers, institutions, key findings, broad trends, and so forth. [0029] The natural language generation system 104 can then be initialized with the first natural language output 110. In various examples, the natural language generation system can be configured with an imitation learning protocol and the natural language generation task 108. The imitation learning protocol 112 can cause the natural language generation system 104 to analyze the training dataset (e.g., the research publications) in the context of the natural language outputs 110 provided by the large language model 102 to learn a policy that mimics the behavior of the large language model 102. As such, the natural language generation system 104 can execute the natural language generation task 108 to generate a second natural language output 114 that mimics the first natural language output 110. [0030] Generally described, the imitation learning protocol 112 can involve collecting demonstrations from an expert, also known as trajectories. The expert can be a human user demonstrating an expected behavior (e.g., how to drive a car). However, in the examples discussed herein, the expert can be the large language model 102. In some approaches such as behavioral cloning, the trajectories can be broken down into state-action pairs which can then be synthesized into a policy that governs the behavior of the model under training (e.g., the natural language generation system 104). [0031] Subsequently, the second natural language output can be provided to the large language model 102 for evaluation against various scoring criteria 116 in combination with a reinforcement learning protocol 118 that defines a reward model 120. As will be elaborated upon below, the scoring criteria 116 can enable the large language model 102 to assess various aspects of the second natural language output 114. For example, the scoring criteria 116 can configure the large language model 102 to evaluate various aspects of the second natural language output 114 such as a textual fluency parameter and an informativeness parameter. Accordingly, the large language model 102 can generate a feedback input 122 and an output score 124 via the reinforcement learning protocol 118. The feedback input 122 and the output score 124 may then be provided to the natural language generation system 104 to cause updates to various parameters. [0032] The feedback input 122 generated by the large language model 102 can be a modification to policies that govern the behavior of the natural language generation system 104. For instance, in the context of a text summarization natural language generation task 108, a policy can define signifiers of important words and/or phrases bear mentioning in a summary generated by the natural language generation system 104. As such, the feedback input 122 can enable the large language model 102 to fine tune the natural language generation system 104 through many iterations such that the second natural language output 114 gradually aligns with the tendencies of the large language model 102. [0033] In addition, the output score 124 can be a numerical metric that quantifies the evaluation of the second natural language output 114 against the scoring criteria 116. Accordingly, the reward model 120 of the reinforcement learning protocol 118 can configure the natural language generation system 104 to seek actions that maximize the output score 124. The reward model 120 can be trained on the feedback inputs 122 generated by the large language model 102 to provide a secondary layer of evaluation for the natural language generation system 104. In various examples, the reinforcement learning protocol 118 can utilize any suitable reinforcement learning methodologies such as policy gradients, proximal policy optimization, and the like. As such, the natural language generation system 104 can generate a third natural language output 126, which can be an iteration of the second natural language output 114 incorporating changes defined by the feedback inputs 122 with the aim of increasing the output score 124. US 2024/0346254 A1 Oct. 17, 2024 [0034] Turning now to large language model 202 is deployed to augment a natural language generation system 204 is shown and described. In contrast to the system 100 discussed above which can be primarily utilized in a model training context, the system can be utilized in a live deployment environment. That is, external users can provide their own inputs 206 with new datasets 208 and natural language generation tasks 210 such as text summarization, conversation dialogue generation, query responses, and text synthesis. As such, the inputs 206 can contain data that the natural language generation system may be unfamiliar with as opposed to the training datasets 106 discussed above with respect to [0035] As mentioned above, the natural language generation system 204 can utilize a small language model 212 which can be configured with a domain-specific dataset 214. In an illustrative example, the natural language generation system 204 can be deployed in a healthcare context (e.g., а hospital information technology system). Accordingly, the domain-specific dataset 214 can be information that is specific to the healthcare context such as patient records, treatment protocols, and internal processes. Due to the smaller size of the small language model 212 relative to the large language model 202, the small language model 212 can benefit from improved adaptability to various contexts. However, small language models 212 can suffer from inferior language understanding and generation quality compared to a large language model 202. As such, by augmenting a natural language generation system 204 with a large language model 202, the system 200 can retain the specialized performance of small language models 212 while improving language understanding and generation capabilities for natural language outputs 216. [0036] In various examples, the system 200 can receive an input 206 containing a dataset 208 and a natural language generation task 210. In a specific example, the dataset 208 can be a research paper while the natural language generation task 210 can be a text summarization task. To augment the input 206, the large language model 202 can retrieve external information 218 based on an external relevance metric 220. The external relevance metric 220 can define a level of relevance for various pieces of external information to the dataset 208 of the input 206. For instance, the dataset 208 can be a research publication of a clinical trial for a new pharmaceutical. Accordingly, external information with a high external relevance metric 220 can be other publications relating to the new pharmaceutical (e.g., dosages, ingredients, intended use). [0037] From an analysis of the external information 218, the large language model 202 can generate an augmentation input 222. The augmentation input 222 can include selected information 224 derived from the external information 218. Continuing with the example of the research publication of a clinical trial for the new pharmaceutical, the selected information 224 can include findings from other clinical trials, information about the manufacturer, and so forth. In this way, the selected information can provide context to the natural language generation system 204 and lead to a robust natural language output 216. Consequently, the system 200 can leverage the language comprehension capabilities of the large language model 202 in various scenarios without incurring the heavy processing loads and latencies associated with a large language model 202. [0038] In another example, the augmentation input 222 can include a question and answer 226 regarding the dataset and/or the external information 218. The question and answer 226 can comprise various predetermined queries that the large language model 202 can answer using the dataset and/or the external information 218 such as notable people, specific information, and the like. In addition to the selected information 224, the question and answer 226 can provide further context regarding the dataset 208 and/or the external information 218. In contrast to the selected information 224 however, the question and answer 226 can provide specificity with a structured format whereas the selected information 224 can be formatted as a general overview. [0039] In still another example, the augmentation input can include an output template 228 as another option for structuring information instead of, or in combination with, the selected information 224 and the question and answer 226. In various examples, the output template 228 can define a predetermined structure that the small language model 212 of the natural language generation system 204 can adhere to when generating the natural language output 216. Moreover, the output template 228 can be generated by the large language model 202 based on the natural language generation task 210. For instance, the natural language generation task 210 can be a text generation task for synthesizing information from various sources. Accordingly, the output template 228 can be a form that defines specific spaces which the small language model 212 can fill in information in accordance with the natural language generation task 210. As such, the output template 228 can reduce the amount of information the small language model 212 must generate thereby enhancing the efficiency of the system 200. [0040] The augmentation input 222 can subsequently be provided to the natural language generation system 204 to configure the small language model 212 with contextual parameters. In this way, the augmentation input 222 supplements the domain-specific dataset 214 to enhance language understanding as well as the quality of the natural language output 216. Similar to the system 100 discussed above, the augmentation input 222 provided by the large language model 202 can improve the informativeness, coherence, fluency, and other language characteristics of the natural language output 216, which can typically suffer in applications of small language models. Therefore, the system 200 can reap the benefits of deep language understanding and high quality generation from the large language model 202 while retaining the adaptability and resource efficiency inherent to the small size of small language models. [0041] Furthermore, the natural language system 204, as an external user facing component of the system 200, can receive external feedback 230. In various examples, the external feedback 230 can include a numerical score for various aspects of the natural language output 216 such as readability, coherence, and language fluency. The external feedback 230 can be processed as part of a reinforcement learning protocol 232 to enable the natural language generation system 204 to improve the quality of the small language model 212 over time. Leveraging human feedback further enhances the quality of the natural language outputs without compromising adaptability and resource efficiency. [0042] Proceeding to language model 302 trains and augments a natural language US 2024/0346254 A1 Oct. 17, 2024 generation system 304 is shown and described. As mentioned above, a large language model 302 can be utilized to train a natural language system 304 through an imitation learning protocol 306 and a reinforcement learning protocol defining a reward model 310. Training the natural language generation system 304 can utilize a training dataset comprising a large corpus of unlabeled data and a natural language generation task 314 that are provided to the large language model 302. In various examples, the natural language generation task 314 can be formatted as a plain language prompt (e.g., "summarize half of the training dataset.") In response, the large language model 302 can generate a first natural language output 316 accomplishing the natural language generation task 314. [0043] A small language model 318 at the natural language generation system 304 can be subsequently configured with the training dataset 312, the first natural language output 316, and the natural language generation task 314. Based on the imitation learning protocol 306, the small language model 318 generates a second natural language output 320 that mimics the first natural language output 316 produced by the large language model 302. The second natural language output 320 can then be returned to the large language model 302 for evaluation against various scoring criteria 322 (e.g., an informativeness parameter, a coherence parameter, a fluency parameter). [0044] Based on the evaluation of the scoring criteria 322, the large language model 302 can generate various feedback inputs 324 that modify various aspects of the small language model 318 to align the small language model 318 with the tendencies of the large language model 302. Moreover, the reward model 310 of the reinforcement learning protocol can generate an output score 326 that quantifies the quality ofthe second natural language output 320 in light of the scoring criteria 322. In addition, the reward model 310 can configure the small language model 318 to seek actions (e.g., the second natural language output 320) that maximize the output score 326. Over many iterations of modifying the second natural language output 320 and feedback inputs 324, the small language model 318 may reach an output score 326 that satisfies a threshold output score. In response, the system 300 can determine that the small language model has achieved a satisfactory level of performance and can begin receiving new inputs (e.g., from external users). [0045] Consequently, the large language model 302 can transition from training the small language model 318 to augmenting the natural language generation system 304 in a live deployment context. Accordingly, the system 300 can receive an input dataset 328 and a second natural language generation task 330. The input dataset 328 can differ from the training dataset 312 in that the input dataset 328 can include data that has not been previously analyzed by the small language model 318 of the natural language generation system 304. [0046] Based on the input dataset 328, the large language model 302 can additionally retrieve pieces of external information 332 which can be utilized by the large language model 302 to generate an augmentation input 334. As mentioned above, the augmentation input 334 can include selected information 336 derived from the input dataset 328 and/or the external information 332 such as key facts, excerpts, statistics, and the like. In addition, the augmentation input 334 can include formats to structure pieces of information such as the question and answer 338. The question and answer 338 can include predetermined queries regarding the input dataset 328 and/or the external information 332. These predetermined queries can lead the large language model 302 to surface specific pieces of information in the form of an answer to question. Similarly, the augmentation input 334 can include an output template 340. In various examples, the output template 340 can define a predetermined structure which the small language model can fill in with information as directed by the output template 340. [0047] Using the augmentation input 334, in addition to a domain-specific knowledge set 342, the natural language generation system 304 can process the input dataset 328. Accordingly, the small language model 318 can generate a third natural language output 344 corresponding to the second natural language generation task 330. In various examples, the third natural language output 344 can be provided to the external source and/or user that provided the input dataset 328 and the second natural language generation task 330. The external source and/or user can subsequently provide external feedback 346 rating various aspects of the third natural language output 344 such as coherence, fluency, and so forth. The external feedback 346 can be analyzed by the natural language generation system 304 and/or the large language model 302 to modify various parameters to improve both augmentation and training over time. [0048] Turning now to large language model 402 trains and augments a natural language generation system 404 in a medical information context is shown and described. In various examples, the system 400 can be part of an information technology infrastructure of a hospital for managing patient records, industry data, research publications, and the like. Accordingly, the natural language generation system 404 can be configured with a domain-specific medical knowledge set 406. The medical knowledge set 406 can contain data that is specific to the context of the system 400 such as the names of associated personnel, organizations, internal processes, and so forth. [0049] To prepare the system 400 for use in the medical information context, the large language model 402 can receive a training dataset 408 comprising a large corpus of unlabeled data such as text, video, audio, and images. The large language model 402 can process the training dataset in accordance with a natural language generation task 410. The natural language generation task 410 can be formatted as a plain language prompt configuring the large language model 402 to execute certain behaviors (e.g., "produce a summary of these research papers.") In response to the natural language generation task 410, the large language model 402 can generate a first natural language output 412. As discussed above, the first natural language output can serve as apseudo-label for the training dataset 408 demonstrating an expected behavior across various natural language generation tasks 410 such as text summarization, conversational dialogue generation, query responses, text synthesis, and so forth. [0050] The first natural language output 412 can be accordingly provided to the natural language generation system 404 along with the training dataset 408 to train a small language model 414 using an imitation learning protocol 416. The small language model 414 can subsequently analyze the training dataset 408 in the context of the first US 2024/0346254 A1 Oct. 17, 2024 natural language output 412 in order to learn behaviors across various natural language tasks such as summarization, dialogue generation, text synthesis, and the like. As such, the small language model 414 can produce a second natural language output 418 that mimics the first natural language output 412. The second natural language output can then be returned to the large language model 402 for evaluation against various scoring criteria such as an informativeness scoring criteria 420, a coherence scoring criteria 422, and a fluency scoring criteria 424. [0051] In various examples, the large language model 402 can select some scoring criteria parameters and not others when evaluating the second natural language output 418 based on the natural language generation task 410. For instance, a text summary natural language generation task can be evaluated under all of the informativeness scoring criteria 420, coherence scoring criteria 422, and fluency scoring criteria 424. Meanwhile, a question and answer natural language task 410 can be evaluated under the informativeness scoring criteria 420 and not necessarily the coherence scoring criteria 422 and/or the fluency scoring criteria 424. [0052] The evaluations of the large language model 402 can be subsequently processed by a reinforcement learning protocol 426 to generate a reward signal comprising a feedback input 428 and an output score 430. As discussed above, the feedback input 428 can cause the natural language generation system 404 to modify various parameters of the small language model 414 to better align subsequent iterations of the second natural language output 418 with the first natural language output 412. As such, the small language model 414 can acquire the natural language performance of the large language model 402 over time. Upon satisfying a threshold output score 430, the system 400 may determine that the small language model 414 has attained a satisfactory level of natural language performance for use in the medical information context mentioned above. [0053] In response, the large language model 402 can transition from previous operations that train the small language model 414 to augmentation in the medical information context. Accordingly, the large language model 402 can receive an input dataset 432 and a second natural language generation task 434 from an external user (e.g., a doctor, a nurse technician). In a specific example, the input dataset 432 can be information gleaned from a patient consultation while the second natural language generation task 434 can be a plain language prompt instructing the system 400 to "generate a patient report for John Doe." [0054] The large language model 402 can proceed to retrieve external information 436 that relates to the second natural language generation task 434 such as information on various medications, illnesses, treatment methods, form documents and so forth. Based on the input dataset 432 and the external information 436, the large language model 402 can generate an augmentation input 438 that can assist the natural language generation system 404 in executing the second natural language generation task 434. For instance, the augmentation input 438 can include selected information derived from the external information 436 as well as an output template 442. In the context of generating a patient report, the output template 442 can be a standard patient report form that the small language model 414 can accordingly fill out using the medical knowledge set 406 in conjunction with the input dataset 432. [0055] For instance, the medical knowledge set 406 can include patient data for the specific "John Doe" that the second natural language generation task 434 refers to such as treatment history, allergies to certain medications, and the like. The medical knowledge set 406 can differ from the external information 436 retrieved by the large language model 402 in terms of specificity. While the large language model 402 can be trained on data provided by the hospital of the present example, achieving granularity at the scale of individual patients may be impractical due to the size and complexity ofthe large language model 402. In contrast, the medical knowledge set 406 of the natural language generation system 404 can be updated and adapted with greater specificity. [0056] In this way, the natural language generation system can produce a third natural language output 444 comprising the patient report for John Doe as requested by the second natural language generation task 434. The third natural language output 444 can accordingly be provided to the external user. In response, the natural language generation system 404 can receive external feedback 446 rating various aspects of the third natural language output 444 such as coherence, language fluency and so forth. The natural language generation system 404 can subsequently use the external feedback 446 to adjust various parameters of the small language model 414 and/or the medical knowledge set to further improve the quality of the third natural language output 444. [0057] Proceeding to performing natural language training using a large language model are shown and described. With reference to the routine 500 begins at operation 502 where a system receives a dataset and a natural language generation task. [0058] Next, at operation 504, the system analyzes the dataset using the large language model. [0059] Then, at operation 506, the system generates a first natural language output based on the natural language generation task. [0060] Next, at operation 508, the system initializes the natural language generation system with the first natural language output generated by the large language model. [0061] Subsequently, at operation 510, the system generates a second natural language output imitating the first natural language output of the large language model using the natural language generation system. [0062] Then, at operation 512, the system evaluates the second natural language output generated by the natural language system using the large language model to generate a feedback input and an output score. [0063] Finally, at operation 514, the system generates a third natural language output using the natural language generation system based on the feedback input to increase the output score. [0064] Turning now to performing natural language training using a large language model are shown and described. With reference to the routine 600 begins at operation 602 where a system receives an input dataset and anatural language generation task. [0065] Next, at operation 604, the system retrieves external information using the large language model based on the input dataset and the natural language generation task. US 2024/0346254 A1 Oct. 17, 2024 [0066] Then, at operation 606, the system analyzes the input dataset and the external information using the large language model to generate an augmentation input. [0067] Subsequently, at operation 608, the system provides the input dataset, the natural language generation task, and the augmentation input to the natural language processing system. [0068] Finally at operation 610, the system analyzes, by the natural language processing system, the input dataset and the augmentation input according to the natural language generation task to generate a natural language output.
