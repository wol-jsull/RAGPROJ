A de - noising filter and algorithm to enhance image pro- cessing , particularly in color images and particularly in removing impulse noise , is disclosed . The algorithm efficiently detects and removes the ran- dom - valued impulse noise in color images , based on the fundamental of Moran's I statistics and Laplacian kernels . The inventive algorithm for noise detection and removal for segmenting an image usually measures the relationships in the pixel space by categorizing the pixels into different classes . Therefore , the existence of noise pixels will create different attributes for pixels that originally belonged to the same cluster . This may generate different clustering out The inventive algorithm removes noise in color images and restores the image , resulting in an image identical or as similar as possible to the original image . Algorithms for removing noise in images are divided into two methods : one for gray - scale images and one for color images . Many state - of - the - art noise removal algorithms have been proposed in the past decades for the gray - scale image . As digital imaging technology has advanced , the necessity for color image processing has been in great demand . Color and multichannel images are most common in many areas of imaging applications , even though gray scale image processing is required in specific fields such as medical imaging on X - ray computed tomography . An important prerequisite to building the algorithm for de - noising filters is taking on the noise models for color images . Image noise occurs in a wide variety of forms . It is very common for noise to contaminate the pixels of images taken by the sensor . During the digitization and transmission in color images consists of three major components : 25 processes , noise can be introduced into each pixel where one Moran’s I for spatial autocorrelation , four 1 - D Laplacian kernels , and the Vector Median Filter ( VMF ) . The previous two components are used for noise detection in the algo- rithm , and the VMF is for de - noising . or more bit - errors will be embedded in the pixels of images . The Gaussian noise model and impulse noise model are two widely used models to characterize the noise information for de - noising filters in digital image processing . The Gaussian The filter is effective in removing impulse noise , based on 30 model is convenient to simulate noise in order to design and a preliminary study on multispectral images . The following vector - type median filters have been tested and compared : Vector Median Filter ( VMF ) , Basic Vector Directional Filter ( BVDF ) , Center Weighted Vector Median Filter ( CWVMF ) , test efficiency of a denoising algorithm . If the noise causes pixel data loss or saturation , the impulse noise model , also called salt - and - pepper noise , will be suitable for the noise characterization . There are also different noises caused by Adaptive Center Weighted Vector Median Filter 35 devices , e.g. , shot noise is due to the thermal fluctuations of ( ACWVMF ) , Peer Group Vector Median Filter ( PGVMF ) , and Robust Switching Vector Median Filter ( RSVMF ) . Impulse noise is one type of noise that can occur in digital images . In image processing , filters such as CWVMF , stationary charge carriers , dark noise occurs in image sen sors such as charge - coupled devices ( CCDs ) . Several different formulations exist for the impulse noise model . Each formulation has its own characteristic in gen ACWVNF PGVMF , and RSVMF remove impulse noise . 40 erating how the density level of noise will be assigned and Impulse noise randomly and sparsely corrupts pixels to two intensity levels , relative high or relative low , compared with its neighboring pixels . To remove heavy noise in an image , it is necessary to how three color channels will be corrupted with certain level of probability . The model assumes that the density level of noise probability is d , and the k value is the color channel index for red , blue , and green . For convenience , the model repeat the filter several times . However , under these condi- 45 assumes that red , green , and blue channel is assigned as 1 , tions most de - noising filters will blur and distort the image . Thus , improvements are needed . , and 3 respectively and 8 - bit pixel image . If 8 is assigned as 0.2 , the 20 percent of entire pixels of a given image is SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to an image de - noising algorithm requires an image noise model to improve the signal - to - noise - ratio ( SNR ) in digital images . The inventive de - noising algorithm is applicable to de noise impulse noise and , when the filter is repeated several 55 times , does not blur or distort the image . The algorithm causes the filter to " converge ” to a saturated state . The major sources of noise corrupted in most digital images are from the process of image acquisition , quanti noise . The first impulse noise model which is uncorrelated impulsive noise 10 is formulated as follows : post with probabilityd xk or ok with probability1 -8 where k – 1 , 2 , and 3 ( 1 ) zation , and transmission . As one common example , when an 60 where rk stands for the random vector that represents the image is transmitted through some wireless mobile net- works , it may be ruined with noisy signals from atmospheric disturbances such as thunder and lightning in the environ- ment . Thus , an image may be degraded such that it will not impulse noise corruption with pE [ 0 ] or rke [ 255 ] ( with equal probability ) , and of represents original color vectors . Those two vectors result in the final outcomes xk of cor rupted image with impulse noise restricted to 0 or 255. This have the same original quality . The consequence of degraded 65 model is called a “ salt - and - pepper ” impulse noise type and images can create potential problems for further image processing and analysis . For example , a clustering algorithm three channels . is limited to only one channel corruption at a time for all US 10,902,563 B2 The second impulse noise model is based on the corre- lation of impulse noise distribution among the color chan- all others with the VMF ; for PGVMF , peer group vector median is P2 because alpha a value is 5 , P2 is the minimum nels and can be expressed as follows : [ 0 , 03 , 0 ° ] with probability 1 - 8 [ yed , 0 % , 0 % ) with probability & for channel 1 ( under o ) X = [ o !, -2 , 0 % ] with probability 62 for channel 2 ( under 8 ) [ 0 , 0 , m3 ] with probability 83 for channel 3 ( under 8 ) [ r ?, -2 , -3 ] with probability 84 for channels ( under 8 ) FIGS . 5A - B shows an area of six regions represented by A , B , C , D , E , and F with a value associated with each region ( FIG . 5A ) and corresponding binary connectivity matrix ( 2 ) distance .

For example , if we assume that the noise level is 0.1 ( i.e. % noise density ) , the d value is 0.1 . Each individual channel will be given 0.25 probabilities under the overall % probability . Consequently , the combination of single channel corruptions from 81 , 82 , and d3 and all channel corruption will be added up to 0.1 probability in total .

The classical median filter ( MF ) is an efficient and com mon non - linear type filtering algorithm to remove impulse noise in gray - level , color , and multichannel images . The median filter has been widely used due to its distinctive property in the impulse response . Its statistical properties have been analyzed and some modifications and generaliza tions have been introduced . The median filter is a simple and efficient algorithm which replaces the center pixel with the median value of the corresponding neighborhood window such as a size of 3 by 3.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIGS . 1A - D compare different impulse noise models . FIG . 1A is an original image ; FIG . 1B is corrupted with the FIG . 1D is corrupted with the noise model - 3 . The probability is set to 10 % for all noise models . All testing simulations herein are based on noise model - 3 . There are many state - of - the - art developments and publi cations for impulse noise removal in color images . Similar 55 to gray - scale methods , many have their own advantages and limitations in terms of performance issues , such as edge preserving capability and efficiency on noise removal . One important function used in the gray - scale methods for the median filter is “ switching based ” median filters . This type 60 of median filters selectively suppress noise pixels leaving those uncorrupted pixels intact . It can preserve the edge details and avoid blurring the image . This mechanism is also used in some versions of the VMF for color images . The inventive use of Moran's I ( statistic ) and four one- 65 dimensional Laplacian kernels improves performance on the capability of noise detection which will then be used for where f is the filtered image , ( x , y ) the location of a pixel , W the neighborhood window in the image , s and t values determined by the window size m and the floor function ( i.e. [ m / 2 ] ) for integer truncation . Although this filtering algorithm was originally devel oped for the gray - scale image , it can intuitively be used in color images with a component - wise extension . The so called marginal standard median filter deals with each red , green , and blue ( RGB ) channel separately , by calculating the median value of each channel within a neighborhood win dow . The restored image is then constructed by combining all RGB channels together as shown in FIG . 2. A pixel consists of RGB components . The median value of each component is calculated and the output is a new vector with the median value in each of RGB components . Conse quently , the filtered pixel will have the median value for each channel as a component in the pixel vector . This filter out considering the correlation which may exist between color channels . As a result , the restored image may have color distortion , i.e. , artifacts . Astola et al . proposed a vector median filter ( VMF ) for impulse noise removal for color images . The VMF is based on ordering the vectors within the neighborhood window by calculating the cumulative pairwise distance and taking the vector corresponding to the lowest - ranked distance as the vector median value for the output . The VMF is formulated as in equation ( 5 ) where the norm L can be implemented as either L2 ( i.e. Euclidean distance ) or other different norms .

While the advantage of the VMF for multi- 10 has the highest entropy among three images . In terms of time where X ; ( Xx ) represents a pixel vector in the window and XVMF is the pixel vector with the lowest - ranked distance . This information reviews two basic filtering algorithms used for impulse noise removal ; most state - of - the - art filters have evolved from these two basic filters . Denoting the marginal standard median filter as MF , because it is an extension of the traditional median filter for color images , the following comparison between the MF and channel data has been noted due to the correlation existing between the multichannel data , in some color images such an advantage may not present . For example , using as an all eight pixels , values are [ 255 , 255 , 0 ] and one noise pixel [ 0 , 255 , 255 ] . Both MF and VMF will have the identical de - noising result . This may be why the MF shows a very competitive result compared with those of VMF in the following experiments based on the PSNR and SSIM mea- sures . Multiple sample images were tested to compare the de - noising quality and time complexity . To assess the de- noising quality , the Peak Signal - to - Noise Ratio ( PSNR ) and Structural Similarity Index Metric ( SSIM ) were used as the quantitative measure . The PSNR is calculated below . maximum gray level for an image . In general , as an image complexity increases , its entropy value also increases . FIG . 3 shows sample Lena , Pepper , and Baboon ( left to right ) images tested . The image size is 512x512 . As shown in the empirical study on the MF and VMF , specifically Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 , the overall results from VMF is not significantly different from those of MF . This is particularly illustrated in Table 3 for Baboon image which complexity , VMF is more than 10 times slower than MF in all test cases . However , VMF is generally considered to be more appropriate for color image processing because it distortion . Even with some advantages over MF , the essen tial problem of slow filtering speed is the major weakness of VMF although some high - speed versions have been pro posed . For real - time applications , the VMF time complexity must be improved . The inventive filter design not only possesses the advan tages of the VMF , but also improves its filtering process speed . Table 1 compares MF and VMF for Lena image with entropy value : 15.12 and s denotes seconds . MF VMF example a 3x3 neighborhood window in a color image with 15 Blue color channels of the image and prevents image color considers inherent correlation between the Red , Green , and PSNR = 10 xlog MSE where N ( lij – li ; ) ? MSE = ?? MXN i = 1 j = 1 and M and N are the width and height of an image , Ijj for individual pixel of the noise - free image and † ; is the corre sponding pixel of the filtered image . The higher value indicates better de - nosing result . The SSIM measures image quality considering human subjectivity in the context of 40 luminance , contrast , and structural similarity . The compari son between original image x and filtered image y can be calculated using the following equation ( 8 ) : where Ux and Hy , are average intensities and ox , o , standard deviations corresponding to images x and y , and oxy for covariance . The values C? and C2 are constants determined by the dynamic range value . To conduct a comparison study for MF and VMF , Lena , Pepper , and Baboon images ( FIG . 3 ) have been tested with 55 % , 10 % , and 15 % noise levels . The size of filtering neighborhood window is 3 by 3 and each image with a size of 512 by 512 pixels . In terms of image complexity , the entropy for each image was calculated using equation ( 9 ) .

Therefore , the peer group vector median filter ( PGVMF ) is based on the trimmed sum of distances . If the number of pixels in the peer group ( denoted by a ) is equal to 9 in the window size of 3 by 3 , it will be identical to the basic VMF algorithm ( FIG . ) . The replaced pixel vector is determined by the pixels located within a peer group of pixels , which shows the minimum distance , or minimum dispersion . FIG . 4 compares VMF and PGVMF . P1 is the vector median because p1 has the minimum distance from itself to all others with the VMF . For PGVMF , peer group vector median is P2 because alpha ( a ) value is 5 , P2 is the minimum distance . Compared to various filters disclosed , the robust switch ing vector median filter ( RSVMF ) has solid noise detection algorithm that enables a filtering process ; if a pixel is determined as a noisy pixel , the RSVMF will use the VMF remains unchanged . The RSVMF works similar to VMF except for the following modification : Some variations of VMF use different distance measures . The basic vector directional filter ( BVDF ) utilizes the angle between two pixel vectors within the window . The summa below . tion of angular distances used in this filter is calculated 20 to remove the noise pixel . Otherwise , the pixel value Q ; = argmin A ( X ; X ; ) i = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , 9 ( 10 ) ifdcenter samed ( di , d2 , dz , . dm ) then no filtering ( 12 ) otherwise , the filtering same as in VMF adaptive center weighted vector median filter ( ACWVMF ) 45 cessing . Variations of the disclosed algorithms improve the was proposed . The main difference between the ACWVMF result in such a way that the filter can preserve edge details mechanism that differentiates between impulse noise and 50 fundamental of Moran’s I statistics and Laplacian kernels is where A ( Xi , Xj ) denotes the angle between pixel vectors Xi and Xj by using the arc cosine function from equation ( 11 ) . A ( X ; X ; ) = COS X ; X | X ||| X ; l The problem with the basic vector median approach is that it can alter some pixels even if there are possibilities that those pixels are actually noise - free . Consequently , the exces- sive filtering causes blurring effects on the de - noised image . To solve this problem , the center weighted vector median filter ( CWVMF ) was proposed to use a weight value for the center pixel in the window . This algorithm , however , has a lack of impulse noise detection scheme . Consequently , the and other filters introduced so far is that it has noise detection capability , instead of performing noise removal on every pixel . This ACWVMF filter provides a switching noise - free pixels . In the ACWVMF , the noise detection step which serves as a switching mechanism is based on the concept of aggregated distances assigned to the pixels in the filtering window . The difference between the accumulated distances assigned to the central pixel and to the pixel with 55 the lowest rank serves as an indicator of the noise . If the indicator is greater than ( or equal to ) a fixed threshold , the output of the ACWVMF is a weighted mean of the central pixel of the filtering window and the vector median of its samples . Otherwise , the pixel is noise - free . In the inventive algorithm , Moran's I statistic has a better indication than the mechanism used in the ACWVMF for noise or noise - free pixel , demonstrated in FIGS . 14-15 , subsequently described . The “ Peer Group ” concept type of filter excludes cor- 65 rupted pixels in the window to calculate the median vector value . The peer group , in short , is the group of pixels in the ( 11 ) where m is the total number of pixels in a window , dcenter cumulative Euclidean distances from the center pixel to pixel 1 , 2 , ... m in the window and a a constant value . The med function is to select median value from the cumulative distances of d ,, d2 , dz , ... dm using the method to calculate the cumulative distance as in the VMF . Another de - noising method is to process vector - based filtering through the trimming scheme . The idea of trimming schemes is to select a group of pixels in the filtering window that may exclude noise pixels through the ranking order . In a sense , this filter is very similar to the PGVMF . However , the RSVMF has some limitation on removing the noise pixels if the noise level is increased to a certain percentage such as 30 % noise used in the experiments described herein . All algorithms disclosed have unique characteristics and limitation to filter impulse noise through vector - based pro and minimize blurring effects . An efficient algorithm for detection and removal of the random - valued impulse noise in color images based on the disclosed . Using a preliminary study on multispectral images shows that this filter is effective in removing impulse noise . The vector - type median filters listed in Table 4 have been tested and compared herein .

An example is given in US 10,902,563 B2 -continued ?? ******** ( y ; y ) 2 = 18x244 ( Wij ) i Hence , Moran's 1 = 6 ( 100 ) / 18 ( 244 ) = 0.1488 From the result in equation ( 14 ) , the I value gives a small positive spatial autocorrelation for the given data . The implementation of Moran's I for noise detection in color images can be done with the same procedure as shown above . The difference now is that a region used in the previous example will be replaced by a pixel in the filtering Table 5 which shows a 3 by 3 filtering window where the intensity range of a given pixel is between 0 and 255 for an - bit color image . Based on the 8 - connectivity concept , a weight matrix similar to FIG . 5B is constructed . The weight ( 13 ) 20 matrix is given in Table 5 ; only one channel is shown . Table 5A is a hypothetical example of 3x3 filtering Window ( one channel only ) , Table 5B is its pixel numbering scheme for the pixels in Table 5A , and Table 5C is the binary connectivity ( i.e. adjacency ) matrix for Table 5A which shows which pixel is adjacent ( marked by 1 ) to pixel number from 0 to 8. Otherwise , O will be used for non - adjacency . For example , for pixel 0 , pixels 1 , 3 , and 4 are adjacent to it .

The previous two components are used for noise detection in the algorithm , and the VMF is for de - noising . Spatial autocorrelation is traced back to the first law of geography : “ Everything is related to everything else , but near things are more related than distant things ” . By defi- nition , spatial autocorrelation is clarified as : “ Spatial auto- correlation refers to the fact that the value of a variable at one point in space is related to the value of that same variable in a nearby location ” . The spatial information concept has been used in pattern recognition and image analysis with different types of formats . Moran introduced areal data . Moran’s I is calculated by the following formula and its range is between -1 and +1 : Moran's 1 = mn ?? Wij ( y1 - 7 ) ( y1 - y ) ??? » ? ( W ; ) y1 - y ) 2 Here , we assume that there are regions and wij is a measure of the spatial proximity between regions i ( with value y :) and j ( with value y ; ) . The parameter y is the mean value of m regions . The interpretation of I value is catego- 30 rized into two specific spatial pattern ; If the value closes to +1 , it indicates a strong homogeneous spatial autocorrelation where local similarity or homogenous spatial patterns exist . A value nearing -1 indicates the strong heterogeneous 35 spatial autocorrelation , but it is a negative pattern that heterogeneous values are grouped together ( e.g. , a mixture of very high and very low values ) . This negative spatial autocorrelation is unusual in nature . For example , high income households are not usually located at urban twilight zones . If I value is zero , it means the absence of any strong spatial autocorrelation or no distinct spatial pattern such as checkerboard . The calculation of Moran's I can be exem plified with the a real data in FIG . 5 ( a ) which is similar to the example in Ref . 27 . To determine the weight value of wij ? it is necessary to check the connectivity between regions i and j ( i.e. imme diate neighbors ) . For example , region A has connectivity 50 with B and C. Region D has connectivity with B , C , E , and F as shown in FIG . 5 ( a ) . Hence , a binary connectivity weight matrix ( shown in FIG . 5 ( b ) ) can be constructed corresponding to the data in FIG . 5 ( a ) . FIG . 5A shows an area of six regions represented by A , B , 55 pixels in the window are relatively similar . In other words , C , D , E , and F with a value associated with each region . FIG . 5B shows corresponding binary connectivity matrix . From the denominator of equation ( 13 ) , " ( y ; -y ) repre- sents the variance of the regional value . As a result , m is replaced by 6 because there are six regions in FIG . 5A . 60 detail . Moran's I is calculated as ( detail omitted ) : Swi ( Vi D y ;-) ) = 6x100 j i Based on the weight matrix formulated , for each color channel of RGB , Moran’s I , MI , can be calculated to check the degree of spatial autocorrelation . If all MI values from three channels have near +1 value , it can be said that all the if any MI value from three channels is close to -1 , there is a high probability that impulse noises exist in the filtering window . The threshold value & , for determining the noise area is set up experimentally , as subsequently explained in By means of a single detector based on Moran's I index , it may not be robust to detect impulse noise precisely . This is because Moran's I is to measure a region's spatial autocorrelation , i.e. , Moran's I focuses on all pixels of the filtering window , not the central pixel itself in the window . Hence , it is required to have the next level detector for ( 14 ) impulse noise . US 10,902,563 B2 Based on the inventive algorithm , if the threshold value o 25 image with different complexity in entropy . Consequently , the denoising process . However , the minimum response 15 and 15 % and the threshold value ? can be properly esti since its value is so small ( i.e. O ) . One reason to set the 20 somewhere between -0.1 and 0.1 from the results of PSNR As shown in Tables 6 and 7 , the best threshold value ? is direction of the 1 - D Laplacian kernel ) , based on the algo- 30 so small such that the selection of this index is not critical to the filtered results . The application of Laplacian kernels is one of the precise and simple detecting algorithms for impulse noise . Several median - based impulse noise detectors often misclassify a noise - free pixel into noise category 4,17 . In the inventive filter , if only Moran's I is used for the detection , there is a chance that pixels located on the lines and edges can be categorized as impulse noise also . Given a hypothetical example as shown in FIG . 6B grids ( a ) and ( b ) respectively , it is assumed this image patch is a line with a direction in 135 degree . It is also assumed that the patch is identical in three channels . Moran’s I value is 0.079 in FIG . 6B grid ( a ) with the center pixel is noise . Based on the proposed algorithm , if the threshold value ? , is set to 0.0 , the center pixel will be detected as a noise pixel ( MI value is not less than the threshold ) and one can progress through from four 1 - D Laplacian kernels is 0. Based on the algorithm in Zhang and Karim , A new impulse detector for switching median filters , IEEE Signal Processing Letters , vol . 9 , no . , ( 2002 ) , the response is not considered as a noise pixel threshold value TO greater than 0 is for the response of Laplacian kernels . Hence , Moran's I can overcome the weakness of the 1 - D Laplacian kernels in this example . If a line is given as shown in FIG . 6B , Moran’s I value is -0.087 . is set to 0.0 , with the second level of detection ( i.e. four 1 - D Laplacian kernels ) , it will be detected as a noise - free pixel based on step 4 ( the condition { o is satisfied , but the condition TO is not satisfied ) . The minimum response from four 1 - D Laplacian kernels is 0 ( with the 135 degree rithm in the Zheng and Karim publication , the response is not considered as a noise pixel since its value is small , i.e. 0. This center pixel will be considered as a noise - free pixel . Hence , the weakness of Moran’s I can be complemented by the four 1 - D Laplacian kernels . In FIG . 6A , four 3 by 3 1 - D Laplacian kernels are used experimentally for the second level noise detection . Both 3 by 3 and 5 by 5 1 - D Laplacian kernels have been tested simultaneously to verify which size of the kernel is more appropriate for the second level detection . Experimentally , 40 both kernels of different sizes do not show any significantly different results . At the first level of noise pixel detection , the corrupted image is tested through Moran's I index , and then if necessary , four 1 - D Laplacian kernels are used in the second level detection . Four 1 - D Laplacian kernels are 45 sensitive to edges with four directions . The minimum abso lute value from the four kernel operators is chosen as the The Laplacian kernel response is denoted as Cy ; and is a kernel operator as shown in equation ( 15 ) . detection value . Ci , = min { x ; j K? : d = 1 to 4 } ( 15 ) where x? , is a pixel and K , is a Laplacian kernel . Each kernel is applied to choose the minimum absolute value in the window . This value is compared to the threshold ( TO ) value to determine whether it is a noise pixel or not ( equation 16 ) . C is used to represent Ci ; for the pixel ( ij ) in the examination in equation 16. If the value is larger than the threshold , it is an impulse noise . If the value is smaller ( or equal ) than the threshold , the current pixel is either noise - free , or edge pixel . Determination of this threshold is subsequently disclosed . From the detection based on Moran’s I and Laplacian kernels response , a pixel is either classified as a noise pixel in which the VMF will be called in to remove the noise , or the pixel value remains unchanged . The remaining issue related to the implementation of MIVMF is determination of the threshold value , because the improper threshold setting can produce unwanted filtering results . First , the threshold value & , for Moran's I should be properly set up to check pixels in the sliding window whether they are located at the noise area or relatively homogenous , noise - free area . Three images , shown in FIG . , were chosen to verify the proper threshold value . All three images were tested with different noise level for 5 % , 10 % , mated . If Moran's I is less than £ o , then the Laplacian kernels will be used to determine if it is a noisy pixel . Otherwise , it is a noise - free pixel . and SSIM . In Table 8 , the best threshold value is between -0.2 and 0. This information can be used as an indication for choosing a threshold value for Moran’s I index for a color the promising PSNR and SSIM results from Lena , Peppers , and Baboon images are located around £ 0 = 0 . Hence , the threshold value was set as £ = 0.0 for all images .

Many images were tested to find out whether there exists any common threshold value which can be used for an image with different complexity . How ever , such a common threshold value could initially not be found . We then hypothesized that image complexity might be related with the threshold value of Laplacian Kernels . Five images shown in FIG . 7 were chosen with different entropy levels and filtered with various threshold values . On the images tested , the threshold range was between 20 and ( FIG . 8 ) . In addition , the noise levels with 5 % , 10 % , and % were tested . In FIG . 8 , only Laplacian kernels were used to determine its threshold ( T. ) for the VMF . For noise levels 10 % and 15 % , the filtering process was run twice to level shown in Tables 9-13 . FIGS . 7A - E shows images Ocean ( FIG . 7A ) , F - 16 fighter ( FIG . 7B ) , Mountain ( FIG . 7C ) , Caster ( FIG . 7D ) , and IC motherboard ( FIG . 7C ) , tested to determine the threshold value for Laplacian Kernels response . The image size is 512 by 512 pixels . The entropy , respectively , 12.99 , 13.76 , 15.48 , 15.73 , and 16.07 . FIG . 8 is comparison for the threshold values used in four - D Laplacian kernels for images tested . Observing experimental results from Tables 9-13 revealed a trend of the pattern to set up a threshold value for Laplacian kernels response for an image . This trend is to increase the threshold value based on the entropy of an 45 image being de - noised as shown in FIG . 8. Therefore , it is straightforward to calculate the entropy of an image to estimate the threshold value .

The algorithm may be repeated if needed , i.e. , the output from the first pass of the algorithm becomes the input for the second pass , and so on . Algorithm : Moran's I Vector Median Filter ( MIVMF ) Step 1 : Read in a noise color image and set threshold values ao and To . ( Selection of threshold values Eo and To disclosed previously and in Table 14 ) color image . Steps 2 to 5 are repeated for each pixel in the image for each iteration . Step 2 : Calculate Moran’s / value ( i.e. MI ) in the neighborhood of the pixel within the defined filtering window for each color component of the Step 3 : Evaluate the four 1 - D Laplacian kernel response values in the neighborhood of the pixel and select the minimum kernel response value ( i.e. Min ) for each color component of the color image . Step 4 : If any MI value from all three color components is less than & o ( 1st level detection ) , and if the Min value from all three color components is larger than T. ( 2nd level detection ) , go to Step 5 ( for de noising ) . Otherwise , go to Step 2 ( it is a noise free pixel ) . Step 5 : Use the VMF for removing noise , and then go to Step 2 . To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare with other well - developed de - noising filters , values are listed in Table 14. All test conditions except the inventive filter are based on the literature suggested param eter values . The size of neighborhood window used for all filters was 3x3 . To compare the de - noising performance , onds are calculated for this purpose . Three images from FIG . are used in the experiments . Some de - noised images are shown in FIGS . 9-12 . In the noise level 10 % and 15 % , both RSVMF and MIVMF were run twice to obtain the best once ; otherwise , the image will be blurred if run more than once ) . For the repetition , the output from the first pass of the algorithm becomes the input for the second pass and so on . Table 14 shows additional parameters for filters used .

It is clear that the filtered result by PGVMF is distorted , in particular , the moustache of the Baboon become very thick . Each filter was repeated three times to obtain the result . In our experiments , there was no significant difference for a filter in terms of the time complexity for processing an image with any noise level or image complexity based on the entropy measure . This can be seen from Tables 15-17 . The proposed MIVMF was best among all the filters tested with human eye perception , all the filters are almost identical , except that BVDF is degrading when the noise level is increased . On the contrary , for an image with medium entropy such decreasing when the noise level is increased , as shown in Table 16. This phenomenon is also shown in the SSIM measure for the BVDF . Otherwise , the SSIM is very similar for all the filters tested . The inventive MIVMF had the best entropy . For images with higher entropy , there exists a trend for all filters that the SSIM is decreasing when the noise level is increasing , except for the VMF in which the 15 % noise shows a high SSIM value as shown in Table 17. In terms of the PSNR measure , all of the filters tested decrease if the image complexity is increased . However , the MIVMF has an overall the highest PSNR value at different noise levels and almost with any complexity of images measured Table 15 below shows results of Lena with entropy 15.12 and T0 = 67 in 5 % , 10 % and 15 % noise levels ; s denotes in entropy . seconds . we tested all the filters listed in Table 4.

Based on the results shown in Tables 15-17 , there is only slight difference on the performance of RSVMF and MIVMF for the low noise - level . Hence , to measure effec tiveness of RSVMF and MIVMF for heavy noises , both filters were tested on 20 % , 25 % , and 30 % noise levels on three images , with results shown in Tables 18-20 . Results are from three iterations of each filter and overall time spent is the sum of three iterations . Test threshold ( a ) for RSVMF is 1.5 based on Ref . 12. While the SSIM was similar for both the higher noise level . The MIVMF had overall the highest PSNR value in those noise levels . In addition , the running time for the MIVMF was less than half of the RSVMF . Table 18 compares RSVMF and MIVMF on Heavy Noise Added Lena Image . s denotes seconds .

Images tested are shown in FIG . 13 which includes Parrot ( entropy 15.25 ) , Penguin ( entropy 15.40 ) , and Koala images ( entropy 16.18 ) . As in Table 14 , 0.0 for Moran's I threshold ? , was used and threshold T was interpolated based on the image entropy . FIG . 14 shows the filtered results . Bar charts represented the PSNR score for each filter tested . To each image 5 % noise was added and each filter was run only once in the experiments . Experi mental results show that the inventive algorithm , MIVMF , had the best PSNR scores . Some filters cause distortion of images and blur the image details if the filter is run multiple times on the image . To test the efficiency of the inventive algorithm , each filter was run with a number of iterations to compare the filtered results . The results were obtained with six iterations for each filter and are shown in FIG . 15. By observing the PSNR curves , all PSNR scores for VMF , BVDF , CWVMF , ACWVMF , PGVMF , and RSVMF are decreasing when the number of iterations is increased . This phenomenon will continue if the filter is iterated again . This indicates that the filtered image was distorted and image details were not preserved . The PSNR scores with the inventive MIVMF either decreased slightly such as shown in FIGS . 15A and 15D , or increased slightly such as shown in FIGS . 15B and 15C . In either case , the MIVMF will reach a saturation state and its PSNR score will not change again . For example , in FIGS . 15A and 15D , the PSNR of the MIVMF will stay in 23.57 and 26.43 , respectively , no matter how many more iterations will be repeated . Similarly , in FIGS . 15B and 15C , the PSNR will stay in 29.59 and 30.33 , respectively . This important char acteristic shows that the MIVMF is an efficient filter with the good detection mechanism for determining if a pixel is noise or not . Hence , the image details will not be damaged or blurred . The MIVMF had the highest PSNR value no matter how many iterations were repeated . In addition , the MIVMF ran much faster than other filters , as shown in Tables 15-20 . FIG . 13. Three images , ( a ) Parrot with 255x197 pixels , ( b ) Penguin with 1024x768 pixels , and ( c ) Koala with 1024x pixels . The entropy for ( a ) is 15.25 , ( b ) 15.40 , and ( c ) 16.18 . By using the interpolation method shown in FIG . 8 , threshold values of T , for ( a ) is 79 , ( b ) 78 , and ( c ) 120.0.0 was used for en for all experiments . FIG . 14. The bar charts show the filtered results ; ( a ) Parrot , ( b ) Penguin , and ( c ) Koala . To each image 5 % noise was added and each filter was run only once in the experi ment . FIG . 15.

Each filter was run six times in the experiments and then each PSNR was calculated for each run . By observing the experimental results in Tables 15-20 , FIGS . 9-12 and 14-15 , the inventive MIVMF showed a promising result compared with other vector - based filters . The inventive de - noising filter accomplishes better time complexity and efficient de - noising results . The two - level detection in color images . It concentrated on the non - fuzzy vector - type median filters . There exist several fuzzy vector type filters which also work well for the noise detection and removal . Work is now concentrating on developing an adaptive method that can estimate the threshold values more accurately , determining if the MIVMF is suitable and effi cient for hyperspectral remote sensing images , extending the inventive detection scheme to other noise models such as Gaussian noise , and exploring the fuzzy vector - type median detection function based on Moran’s I and 1 - D Laplacian 10 filters and determine if the fuzzy mathematics can improve kernels works properly so that it reduced processing time and produced better filtered results compared with other similar type of vector - based filters . In summary , the inventive noise detection and removal filter which uses Moran's I statistics ( i.e. MI value ) for 15 calculating the spatial autocorrelation indexes and combin- ing with four 1 - D Laplacian kernels for random - valued impulse noise detection for color images . To the inventors ' best knowledge , this may be the first attempt by using Moran’s I statistics for color image de - noising . This is an 20 adaptive filter in which the MI value and response of four - D Laplacian kernels are calculated for each 3 by 3 neighborhood window . This two - level noise detection scheme works efficiently as it has the capability of distin- guishing a given pixel as noise or not . The VMF is then used 25 ( 2002 ) . to process those noisy pixels and leave noise - free pixels untouched . The inventive filter can be considered as an efficient extension of the VMF in a sense . As an extension , the inventive filter can achieve better de - noising results and entirety . the inventive MIVMF performance for de - noising .
