Example Definitions Channel can be a grayscale image of the same size as a color image , but made of just one primary color . For In one aspect , a computerized method useful for reducing block boundary artifacts in a digital image processing that 40 however , that the invention may be practiced without one or FIG . 2 illustrates an example method for reducing block 55 method . Although various arrow types and line types may be boundary artifacts when encoding a digital image , according US 11,328,398 B2 instance , an image from a standard digital camera will have a a red , green and blue channel . Compression artifact is a noticeable distortion of media caused by the application of lossy data compression . A box ( e.g. a pixel box ) can be a set of nxn pixels of a digital image . Boxes can be scrambled and / or otherwise reordered to encode the digital image . Example Methods In one example embodiment , a digital image can be a scrambled digital image . In step 304 , process 300 can descramble the scramble digital image into two copies . In step 306 , process 300 can detect boundary artifacts in a first copy of the digital image . For example , the grid of FIG . 1 can be apparent in the descrambled digital image . In step , process 300 can sample the center rows and / or columns of the box grid of the second copy of the digital image . For example , process 300 can use a line of pixels of the center of a corresponding box of the second image as a correspond scrambled and / or otherwise encoded before it becomes 10 ing border of first image . This is become the information that publicly accessible . The digital image can be doubled to create two copies . A first copy of the digital image can be divided into a grid of uniform boxes of a specified pixel size . This grid can then be offset ( e.g. by half the box size of the is lost as borders in the first copy of the image is not a border but rather a center of the second copy of the image due to the offset of formatting the boxes of the second copy . In step , process 300 can replace the boundaries of the first copy first copy of the digital image , etc. ) for the second copy of 15 with the sampled - center rows and / or columns the second the digital image . The boxes can then be used as units for scrambling the two copies of the digital together . When the scrambled digital image is descrambled , a boundary artifact can be detected in the grid boundaries of copy . It is noted that noise reduction and / or other algorithms can be implemented to further reduce the remaining distor tion in the descrambled image ( e.g. the four corner pixels of the boundary of line , etc. ) . Using processes 200-300 , an the first copy of the digital image . The boundary artifact can 20 original image can be reduced in size , scrambled and then be the result of a loss of information at the boundaries of the boxes during a lossy compression and / or other digital image manipulation processes that occurs while the digital image is in a scrambled state . The boundary artifact can be reduced descramble and brought back to original size with less error . FIG . 4 illustrates an example pair of copies 400 of a single image to be scrambled , according to some embodiments . Area 402 is a grid of a first copy of the digital image . Area by sampling the middle / center rows and / or columns of the 25 404 is an offset grid of second copy of digital image . The boxes of the offset grid of the second copy of the digital image . These non - boundary center rows and / or columns can then be substituted for the grid boundaries of the first copy . In this way , given a box size of ten by ten ( 10x10 ) pixels , a border error of forty ( 40 ) pixels can be reduced to four 30 ( pixels ) , for example . FIG . 2 illustrates an example method 200 for reducing block boundary artifacts when encoding a digital image , according to some embodiments . In step 202 , process 200 boxes of both copies can be scrambled together into a single encoded image . In some examples , the partial border boxes of the second copy can be combined together such that all the boxes are of equal size before a scrambling process . FIG . 5 a process 500 of scrambling a digital image , according to some embodiments . In step 502 , process 500 can obtain a digital image . In step 504 , process 500 can generate a uniform grid of boxes in the digital image . In step , process 500 can , at the boundary of each box in the can obtain a digital image . In step 204 , process 200 can 35 grid , replicate the boundary pixels a specified number of create a copy the digital image . In step 206 , process 200 can delineate a first pixel - box grid on the digital image . A pixel box can be a unit of the digital image to be reordered / scrambled . A box size can be measured by the number of a times to generate a thicker boundary . In step 508 , process can scramble boxes of digital image . It is noted that the frame of a box can be a duplication of pixels of the border of the box . For example , the border of the box can be pixels in each boundary . For example , a box can be five by 40 one - pixel of thickness . The frame can be the one - pixel of five pixels , ten by ten pixels , etc. Step 206 can begin box delineation at a specified set of coordinates ( e.g. ( 0 , 0 ) ) and then , depending on the box size , step 206 delineate the remainder of the box . thickness copied to a four ( or other number ) pixel - depth of thickness . This can provide a ' safety ' frame that may with stand the later distortions ( e.g. compression , resizing , encod ing , etc. ) of the image . If when the digital image is later In step 208 , process 200 can delineate a second pixel - box 45 descrambled and the boundary artifact is detected , then the other processes can be utilized to remove the boundary grid on the copied digital image . The second pixel - box grid coordinates can a specified offset of the first pixel - box grid's coordinates . For example , the specified coordinates for the first image begin at coordinate ( 0,0 ) and the box size is ten artifacts . It is noted that scrambling can be a process of randomly mixing up a sampled - set of pixel boxes . In some example by ten ( 10x10 ) pixels . The offset for the second box can be 50 embodiments , the pixel boxes can be non - randomly sorted offset half the length of the boundary of the first image's boxes . For example , the delineation of the copied images boxes can be at coordinate ( 5,5 ) and the box size can be ten by ten ( 10x10 ) pixels . In some example embodiments , the using a set order as determined by various attributes of the original digital image . For example , instead of a random selection ( e.g. as determined by a pseudo - random number generation process , etc. ) an ordered selection of pixel - boxes first copy image can then be placed in a single double digital 55 sorted can be based on taking an average value of each a image with the second copy image . In step 210 , process 100 join the original digital image and the copy of the digital image . The boxes of the two digital images can be offset . In step 212 , process 200 can channel and then resort on three ( 3 ) planes ( e.g. luminance , chrominance , etc. ) Exemplary Computer Architecture and Systems FIG . 6 depicts an exemplary computing system 600 that scrabble and / or otherwise reorder the boxes of the image and 60 can be configured to perform any one of the processes the copy of the image into an encoded image the two digital images . For example , the boxes of the two digital images can be scrambled together into a single scrambled and / or oth- erwise encoded digital images . provided herein .
